# MySql SpeedSheet

The MySql speedsheet covers all things related to the MySql database. The speedsheet is hosted on [speedsheet.io](https://speedsheet.io). This is the raw content for that speedsheet.

# Status

Content: Reasonably Good Coverage, But With Holes

The sheet covers many topics including creating databases and tables, basic sql commands, data types and many basic operations. There are probably areas that need more coverage.

We love speedsheets and we'd love to have them for every language and library out there. But we don't have remotely enough time for all the great docs we want to create. If you would like to help, you can submit updates right here. It would be greatly appreciated! 

And thanks!
